# 🚀 My HackerRank Learning Journey

Welcome to my code sanctuary! This repository is a living document of my progress through HackerRank's technical tracks. As an Information Technology student, I use these challenges to sharpen my logic, prepare for college assessments, and master the building blocks of software development.

## 📌 The Goal
My primary focus is mastering **Data Manipulation (SQL)** and **Problem Solving (Java/JS)** to build a strong foundation for my web applications and college mini-projects.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure
I have organized my solutions by domain and difficulty to make them easily accessible for revision.

* **`/SQL`**: Queries for MySQL/Oracle.

---


## 📬 Connect with Me
I'm always open to discussing better logic or more optimized ways to solve these problems!
